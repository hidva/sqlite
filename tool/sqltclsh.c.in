/*
** This is the source code to a "tclsh" that has SQLite built-in.
**
** The startup script is located as follows:
**
**   (1)  Open the executable as an appended SQLite database and try to
**        read the startup script out of that database.
**
**   (2)  If the first argument is a readable file, try to open that file
**        as an SQLite database and read the startup script out of that
**        database.
**
**   (3)  If the first argument is a readable file with a ".tcl" extension,
**        then try to run that script directly.
**
** If none of the above steps work, then the program runs as an interactive
** tclsh.
